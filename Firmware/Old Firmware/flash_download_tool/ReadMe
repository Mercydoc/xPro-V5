Do not use any other .bin found in the firmawre folder with this tool!

Only use the ```xPV5xyyz.bin``` file found in this (flash_download_tool)[https://github.com/Spark-Concepts/xPro-V5/tree/main/Firmware/Old%20Firmware/flash_download_tool] 
folder with the flash tool as it contains the nessisary bootloaders for proper configurations (factory default). 

Once you have used the flash tool - you will need to connect to the xProV5 via wifi and upload the index.html.gz file; in addition you may upload to the latest firmware (found under the xPro-V5/Firmware folder via wifi)
