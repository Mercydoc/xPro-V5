Only use the xPV5xyyz.bin file found in the flash_download_tool folder (https://github.com/Spark-Concepts/xPro-V5/tree/main/Firmware/Old%20Firmware/flash_download_tool)
Do not use any other .bin found in the firmawre folder with this tool - as xPV5xyyz.bin contains the nessisary bootloaders for proper configurations (factory default). 

Once you have used the flash tool - you will need to connect to the xProV5 via wifi and upload the index.html.gz file

In addition, via Wifi only, you may want to upload to the latest firmware for your actual configuration (found under the xPro-V5/Firmware folder)
